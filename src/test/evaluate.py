    Each entry in the data dictionary should have the following format:
        
        data_dictionary = [{'data_set_name': <string>,
                            'data_set_path': <string>,
                            'data_set_identifer': <string>}]
    
    where data_set_name is the name of the data set file in the data_set_path,
    and data_set_identifier is the name that should be given to the dataset
    in the output pandas table.
    
    Each data_set file is assumed to be keyed by ID, with subdictionaries key
    as 'predictions' and 'targets' with the corresponding predictions and targets.
    
    For each data_set, metrics at both the signal-level and epoch-level will be
    calculated. For the epoch-level, only non-Wake epochs will be considered.
    An epoch will be considered to be an apnea epoch if the total length of the
    apneic events exceeds the apnea_threshold_for_epoch (which is in units of 
    seconds).
    
    INPUTS:
        data_dictionary: see above for descrption.
        metrics: list of metrics to apply on sample and epoch level.
        data_path: where stage file and apnea/hypopnea targets live
        stage_file: name of staging file
        save_path: where to save results
        save_name: what to name saved results
        apnea_threshold_for_epoch: the total length of apneic events required for a
            sleep epoch to be called an apnea epoch
        sampling_rate: sampling_rate at which labels were assigned, typically 10 Hz
        epoch_length: epoch_length in seconds, typically 30 s
    
    RETURNS:
        pandas dataframe showing results. Also saves results as a .csv file
        using the save_path and save_name input arguments.
